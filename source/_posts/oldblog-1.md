自从上了大学，就几乎很少再写自己的博客了。记得在高中的时候，微博还没有兴起，拥有一个博客正如同如今玩微信一样是潮流。回顾那时的自己，只要有些许的感慨，变回记录下来，有的以古文结合现代文的形式，有的以诗歌的形式写下来，甚是有趣。恰好在github上用hexo刚搭建了自己的博客，想将原来的内容迁移过来，顺便学习一下静态博客的markdown语法，以及回看自己昔日的成长心路历程。

> Although there are much homework everyday,
In the dormitory,there are always many laughter.
All of us don't go to sleep until 12 o'clock.
Some were playing chess ,some were talking,
some were eating,some were singing.

> The school life wasn't exactly as what I had expected .
But as far as I am concerned,it's really rich.
I feel that everything special and fresh.
So I enjoy my busy life in the OCT school.

### Feeling

那时候我记得我还是高一的时候，上2个月左右的学，觉得高中真的很幸福，能在最好的班级，认识许多新的小伙伴，一起读书玩耍吧。但是整个文章英文写起来都是偏口语化的，毕竟刚上高一，英文还停留在初中的水平..比如语法主系表结构的 

> I am really happy 

被我写成了
>I really happy。

虽然语言都比较滑稽，但是现在回看自己写过的东西，都会暗暗的偷笑，似乎在窥探一个人的隐私或心路历程一样，只不过那个是存在回忆中的自己。
